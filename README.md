## 🧑‍💻 A Portfolio Challenge

This is a simple portfolio website I recreated as part of a personal coding challenge. My friend built a sleek portfolio and challenged me to replicate it from scratch. After 10 hours of deep focus, I managed to build a working version using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
